									<h2>LeadMe - Details for Nerds</h2>

                  At the heart of the anklet is an ATMega328-based microcontroller with an onboard crystal and other necessary components (pull-up resistor on the reset line; decoupling capacitors). The firmware on the board utilizes the Arduino bootloader and a custom script. The script receives direction instructions over UART (coded with a custom protocol optimized for the anklet) and determines PWM outputs for some of five different ports, mixing duty cycles to estimate the direction as precisely as possible.  It also returns current PWM values.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Communication is interfaced over an HC-05-based propriatery bluetooth module which is paired with an Android phone. Each PWM line drives one of 5 MOSFETs on two motor control boards, which in turn drive one of the five coin-style vibration motors spaced evenly around the device. The system is powered by a Lithium-Polymer cell and the voltage is regulated to 3v3. Onboard is also a USB LiPo charger connected to a Micro-USB port on the rear of the device.

									The anklet consists of a unibody casing that houses the electronics and has a buckle for your ankle. It is made of a soft yet sturdy silicone rubber cast in a 3D printed mold. The mold is coated with a laminating epoxy designed to get rid of all imperfections and striations. The casing and buckle is made using a unique three phase casting process. We first coat the bottom half of the mold with a thin layer of silicone to form the outside of the buckle. Once that dries, we place in the electronics and fill the bottom half of the mold. After six hours, we then join the top half of the mold with the bottom half and fill it to the top. Throughout this entire process we degas the mold regularly to ensure there are no air bubbles in the silicone.

									The USB charging port is neatly hidden at the very back of the bracelet for inconspicuous and easy access. In addition, we have an indicator LED displaying the device's Bluetooth status - whether or not a phone is paired.
								</p>
								<p>
									The mold went through five iterations, each time improving a single feature. Through these five iterations, we improved sizing for a variety of ankles, buckle design and dimensions, size of the mold cavity to house the electronics, different surface finishes, vent holes, sprue holes, and degassing methods.

									All of this was done with a budget of $250. Here's a full list of where the money went:
